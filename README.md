# DAM Ecosystem Mapping

This repository is part of the Digital Asset Management Ecosystem Assessment project at the Hesburgh Libraries.

One component of the project is to gather a draft of the systems that currently contribute to the ecosystem. See the [project charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pw-cuIuwyovFWQ23uH896Hr0iefDRb7YE78aUl4h_wU/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=103549390016362126215) for greater context.

### States

* Pending - Waiting on a conversation to better understand
* First Pass - Written as a matter of starting a conversation.

### Directonal Arrows

Bi-directional - Both elements know of each other
Uni-directional - The pointing element knows about the target of the arrow, the targeted element does not know about the pointing element

### Concering Applications

This documentation does not look to articulate what "goes in" an application. Instead to define the technology (in particular storage) and interactions between systems.
