# DAM Ecosystem Mapping

This repository is part of the Digital Asset Management Ecosystem Assessment project at the Hesburgh Libraries.

One component of the project is to gather a draft of the systems that currently contribute to the ecosystem. See the [project charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pw-cuIuwyovFWQ23uH896Hr0iefDRb7YE78aUl4h_wU/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=103549390016362126215) for greater context.

### States

* Pending - Waiting on a conversation to better understand
* First Pass - Written as a matter of starting a conversation.

### Directonal Arrows

* Bi-directional - Both elements know that each other exist
* Uni-directional - The pointing element knows of the existence of the target of the arrow, the targeted element does not know that the pointing element

### Concering Applications

This documentation does not look to articulate what "goes in" an application. Instead to define the technology (in particular storage) and interactions between systems.

The goal of the documentation is not to identify data flow but instead where data (either metadata or digital objects) may exist
