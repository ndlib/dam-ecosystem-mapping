# DAM Ecosystem Mapping

This repository is part of the Digital Asset Management Ecosystem Assessment project at the Hesburgh Libraries.

One component of the project is to gather a draft of the systems that currently contribute to the ecosystem. See the [project charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pw-cuIuwyovFWQ23uH896Hr0iefDRb7YE78aUl4h_wU/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=103549390016362126215) for greater context.
